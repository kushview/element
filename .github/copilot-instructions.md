## General Conventions

- **Always check documentation**: Before making assumptions about APIs, libraries, or tools, consult the official documentation first.
- **Do not make assumptions and guesses**: When uncertain about implementation details, research or ask rather than guessing.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication. Extract common functionality into reusable functions or components.

## Code Quality

- Write clear, readable code with descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase style and patterns.
